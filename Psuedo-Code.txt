Blackjack


The game begins with two people: a dealer and a player. 
The objective of the game is to have a hand of higher value than the other without going over 21.
Number cards are worth their value, face cards are worth 10, and Aces are interchangeably 1 or 11.
To start a round, the dealer deals two face-up cards for the player and a face-up card and a face-down card for himself.
After looking over both hands, the player bets a certain amount of money based on his odds of winning.

While the player's hand is under 22:
	The player can now call for either a hit or stand.
	If the player stands:
		The player keeps his hand as is.
		The dealer flips their face-down card. 
		While the dealer's hand is under 22:
			The dealer continually draws.
			If the dealer's hand is over 15:
				The dealer stops drawing.
				If the dealer's hand is greater than the player's:
					The dealer wins and take the player's bet.
				elseif the dealer's hand is tied with the player's:
					The game is a tie, no money is won or lost.
				else:
					The player wins and gains double what they bet.
		If the dealer's hand is greater than 21:
			The player wins and gains double what they bet.

	If the player hits:
		The player gets another card.
		If the player's hand is over 21:
			The dealer wins and take the player's bet.
